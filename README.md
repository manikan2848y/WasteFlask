# Waste Classification Project

## Overview

This project is a machine learning-based waste classification system that identifies recyclable and non-recyclable materials from images. Using a deep learning model (DenseNet121), the system processes input images and predicts the type of waste material, enabling proper waste segregation for environmental sustainability.

---

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Identifies the type of waste (e.g., cardboard, plastic, glass, metal, paper, etc.).
- **Recyclability Detection**: Determines whether the waste item is recyclable or not.
- **High Accuracy**: Built with a pre-trained DenseNet121 model for robust and reliable predictions.
- **User-Friendly**: Easily integrates into applications like mobile apps, web apps, or industrial waste management systems.

## Model and Data

### Model

The project utilizes the **DenseNet121** architecture, which is a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). DenseNet121 is known for its efficiency and high performance in image recognition tasks. The model was fine-tuned on a custom dataset to classify waste materials.

### Dataset

The dataset includes labeled images of various waste categories, divided into:

- **Recyclable Waste**:
  - Cardboard
  - Glass
  - Metal
  - Plastic
  - Paper
- **Non-Recyclable Waste**:
  - Food Organics
  - Textile Trash
  - Miscellaneous Trash

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waste-classification.git
   cd waste-classification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

### Prediction Script

To classify an image, use the provided `detect_recyclable()` function:

```python
from your_script_name import detect_recyclable

# Example image path
image_file = "path/to/image.jpg"

detect_recyclable(image_file)
```

### Output

The system outputs:

- **Predicted Class**: Type of waste (e.g., "plastic").
- **Recyclability**: Whether the item is recyclable.

### Debugging Script

For detailed insights into the model's predictions, use the `debug_predictions()` function:

```python
from your_script_name import debug_predictions

debug_predictions(image_file)
```

## Key Functions

### 1. `load_and_preprocess_image(img_path)`

Loads and preprocesses the input image for the DenseNet121 model.

### 2. `predict(images)`

Predicts class probabilities for the input images.

### 3. `detect_recyclable(image_file)`

Classifies the waste item and determines recyclability.

### 4. `debug_predictions(image_file)`

Provides a detailed breakdown of predictions for debugging purposes.
